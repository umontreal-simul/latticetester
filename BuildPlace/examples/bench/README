This folder contains a bunch of matrices in different files.
These matrices are random matrices generated with the genmat.py python3
script.
Even though random matrices are not the usual use case for LatticeTester, we
use the matrices in this folder as a test set for our examples. Having random
dense matrices pushes certain algorithms to their limits. If you want to
execute the examples with limited ressources, it might be wise to create a
smaller test set.

About the file names:
Matrices are stored in the files with a .dat extension. The first number in
the name is a prime the was choosen to be close to (but smaller than) a
particular power of 2:
  - 1021                 is close to 1024                 = 2^10
  - 1048573              is close to 1048576              = 2^20
  - 1073741827           is close to 1073741824           = 2^30
  - 1099511627791        is close to 1099511627776        = 2^40
  - 1125899906842597     is close to 1125899906842624     = 2^50
  - 18446744073709551629 is close to 18446744073709551616 = 2^64
The second number is the dimension of the matrix contained in the file.
the third number is the number of the matrix since 10 matrices have been
generated for each prime/dimension combination.

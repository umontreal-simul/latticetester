/**
 * This example presents how to use LatticeTester to make a figure of merit that
 * is a weighted sum, maximum, minimum or average of a mesure on projections on
 * a lattice. This examples shows how to use the weight classes, how to build
 * projections of a basis, but also how to normalize a computation. Typically,
 * when building figures of merit, mesures need to be rescalled to the same
 * interval to be compared with one another, this is what is called
 * normalization.
 * 
 * This example computes a simple spectral test on all projections of a lattice
 * in dimension 10, normalizes it between 0 and 1 and then takes the minimal
 * value observed as a figure of merit for that lattice.
 *
 * This example outputs only the figure of merit for the lattice for two
 * different normalizers. This is not really interesting in itself, hence it is
 * not included here. To get interesting informations on a figure of merit like
 * this one, it would be possible to store an few of the worst projections and
 * print them after the test.

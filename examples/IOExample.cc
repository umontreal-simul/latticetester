/**
 * This example uses the LatticeTester API to read and print from/to files.
 * This does a really simple usage of the ParamReader and the WriterRes classes.
 *
 * ParamReader is a class that can easily be used to read a file, split its lines
 * and "tokenize" them so that the program can read files word by word and
 * convert the words to different types. This class can also easily be extended
 * to read other types than those already present, as is done in LatMRG.
 *
 * WriterRes is anothers class that simplifies the creation of a stream to write
 * to a file. Just as ParamReader, this can also convert data types into strings
 * to write directly in the file.
 *
 * The output of this program look like this : 
 * We can write messages in the file.
 * Here is one way to write a matrix.

 * It's also possible to use *ToString() methods to write stuff in the output

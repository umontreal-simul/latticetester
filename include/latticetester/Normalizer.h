 * Classes which inherit from this base class are used in implementing bounds
 * on the length of the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice
 * \cite mCON99a&thinsp;. These bounds are used to normalize the length of
 * the shortest vectors. Tight lower bounds are available for all dimensions
 * for many important cases. In most cases, the \f${\mathcal{L}}_2\f$ norm is
 * used to compute the length of vectors.
 *
 * For some figures of merit, no useful bounds are known to normalize the
 * length of the shortest vector. In these cases, this base class will be
 * used as normalizer since it simply sets all normalization constants to 1.
 * This is necessary because the tests compare the normalized values of the
 * merit when searching for good lattices.

    * large \f$t\f$ in a worst-case figure of merit. One normally uses
    * \f$\beta= 1\f$.

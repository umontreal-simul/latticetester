  /**
   * Classes which inherit from this base class are used in implementing bounds
   * on the length of the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice.
   *
   * Given a lattice in dimension \f$t\f$, it is possible to center
   * non-interlapping spheres of radius \f$ d_t \f$ where \f$ d_t \f$ is the
   * lenght of the shortest vector in the lattice. It turns out that the
   * proportion of the space covered by these spheres can be used as a figure of
   * merit for both the dual and the primal lattice. Suppose \f$ V \f$ contains
   * the basis of the lattice in its lines. Then the density of the lattice is
   * defined by \f$ \frac{1}{|\text{det}(V)|} \f$. It is the number of points
   * that the (not rescalled) lattice
   * will have in \f$[0,1)^t\f$. It is easy to see that the amount of space that
   * will be covered by the spheres is
   * \f[
   *    \text{Volume of an }n\text{-sphere of radius }d_n\times\text{Density of the lattice}}.
   * \f]
   * There are known upper bounds on the greatest proportion of the space that
   * can be covered in that way \cite mCON99a. If we divide the proportion of
   * the space covered in the current lattice by such an upper bound, the number
   * obtained is what we call **normalized**. This means that the number we will
   * get will be somewhere between 0 and 1 and that it can be used to compare the
   * distribution of the points of the lattice with the points of other lattices.
   * Having a value closer to 1 means a more evenly distributed lattice in some
   * way (see the section on the figures of merit to see which tests use this in
   * the intro). This class is intended as an interface to implement such
   * bounds. It is possible that subclasses of this one implement bounds for a
   * different interpretation of this problem, please look at their documentation
   * before using them. The bounds also sometimes use different norms.
   *
   * This base classe initializes the bounds at 1 and can be used if no
   * normalization can be done, or has to be done. This can be usefull in a few
   * implementations if there is a switch at runtime to instanciate a
   * `Normalizer` subclass because there will be no need to duplicate the code
   * for the case with no normalization.
   *
   * To create a subclass of this one, it is important to implement the
   * getGamma(int) const, getBound(int) const and init() methods and to call
   * the init() method in the constructor to pre-compute the bounds this class
   * will use for normalization.
   *
   * To instanciate this class or its subclasses, the usage of the copy
   * constructor or of the assignment = is prohibited by the fact that these
   * methods are private. The prefered usage for this class is to declare a
   * pointer to a Normalizer and to instanciate subclasses with dynamically 
   * allocated memory:
   * \code{.cpp}
   * Normalizer<RScal>* norma;
   * norma = new NormaBestLat<RScal>(logDensity, t);
   * delete norma;
   * \endcode

         * in all dimensions \f$\leq t\f$. Ususally, such a normalizer will
         * return bounds that take into a account the density. `Name` allows the
         * user to give a name to a normalizer object. This name will be printed
         * by the ToString() method. It serves no purpose implementation-wise,
         * but this can be usefull while debugging code. `norm` is the NormType
         * that will be used by this object. It cannot be changed. The usage of
         * `beta` is deprecated. This is a bias factor that can be usefull in
         * the case where a figure of merit with numerous projections is
         * computed. It can be used to give more weight to the first dimensions
         * by taking \f$\beta< 1\f$. It inflates the figures of merit by
         * \f$(1/\beta)^t\f$, thus weakening the requirements for good results
         * in large dimensions in a worst-case figure of merit. One normally
         * uses \f$\beta= 1\f$.
         *
         * Note that the log value of the density is stored (instead of the density 
         * itself) so it is easier to manipulate really large values of density.
         *
         * \remark **Richard:** Je crois que ce facteur `beta` devrait
         * disparaître car des poids beaucoup plus généraux sont maintenant
         * implantés dans les classes `*Weights`.
         * **Marc-Antoine:** Je crois que le design de cette classe est à
         * repenser. Il est probablement intéressant de considérer la logDensity
         * en tableaux parce que dans certaines applications la densité change
         * en fonction de la dimension.

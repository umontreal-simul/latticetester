/**
 * This is a base class for implementing normalization constants used in figures of merit,
 * to normalize the length of the shortest nonzero vector in either the primal or dual lattice.
 * These constants are based on upper bounds (or approximations) on the best possible length,
 * for given lattice density and dimension.
 * The various subclasses of this class implement specific bounds.
 *
 * Given a lattice of density \f$ \eta \f$ in \f$t\f$ dimensions,
 * the Euclidean length \f$ d_t \f$ of a shortest nonzero lattice vector is upper-bounded as follows:
 * \f[
 *    d_t \le  d_t^*(\eta) \eqdef \gamma_t^{1/2} \eta^{-1/t},
 * \f]
 * where the constants  \f$ \gamma_t \f$ are known exactly only for  \f$ t\leq 8\f$.
 * For larger values of  \f$ t \f$, we use bounds or approximations of these constants,
 * which are defined in subclasses of `Normalizer`.
 * These bounds also hold for the  \f$ L^1\f$ lengths of the shortest vectors,
 * but with different constants  \f$ \gamma_t \f$.
 * In the dual lattice, the density is \f$1/\eta\f$ instead, and the Euclidean length
 * \f$ \ell_t \f$ of a shortest nonzero lattice vector then obeys:
 * \f[
 *    \ell_t \le  \ell_t^*(\eta) \eqdef \gamma_t^{1/2} \eta^{1/t}.
 * \f]
 * The bounds \f$ d_t^*(\eta)\f$ and \f$ \ell_t^*(\eta)\f$ are used to normalize
 * the values of \f$ d_t \f$ or \f$ \ell_t \f$ computed by the software for given lattices
 * to obtain standardized measures that lie between 0 and 1.
 * For the best lattices, these measures should be close to 1.
 *
 * Subclasses of this abstract class provide facilities to compute the bounds
 * \f$ d_t^*(\eta)\f$ or \f$ \ell_t^*(\eta)\f$ for a selected range of dimensions \f$ t \f$.
 * One constructor will take this range (the maximum dimension) and the log of the density,
 * \f$ \log \eta \f$, as inputs. We work with the log density instead of the density itself
 * because the latter is sometimes extremely large or extremely small.
 * This constructor works fine when the density \f$ \eta\f$ is the same in all dimensions.
 * Note that the log density of an arbitrary integral lattice with basis `V` can be computed
 * via `-log(abs(det(V)))`.
 *
 * But sometimes, the density may depend on the dimension.
 * This occurs for example for the lattice obtained from an MRG with modulus \f$ m\f$ and order \f$ k\f$,
 * whose density is typically \f$ m^k\f$ in \f$ s\ge k\f$ dimensions, and \f$ m^s\f$
 * in \f$ s < k\f$ dimensions.  The bounds can then be computed by taking this into account.
 * This is done by passing \f$ m\f$ and \f$ k\f$ as inputs to the constructor (in subclasses).
 *
 * In subclasses, it is important to implement the
 * `getGamma(int) const` and `computeBounds` methods and to call the latter
 * to precompute the bounds.
 * The constructors in this abstract class do not compute any bounds, they basically just reserve
 * the space (an array) for the bounds.
 *
 * The prefered usage for this class is to declare a pointer to a Normalizer
 * and to instantiate a subclass with dynamically allocated memory:
 * \code{.cpp}
 * Normalizer* norma;
 * norma = new NormaBestLat(logDensity, maxDim);
 *    ...
 * delete norma;
 * \endcode
 *
 * Important: when making a search and examining millions of lattices, it is important
 * NOT to construct a new Normalizer object and to recompute the constants for each lattice.

   * These constants are based on upper bounds (or approximations) on the best possible length,
   * for given lattice density and dimension.  
   * The various subclasses of this class implement specific bounds.
   *
   * Given a lattice in dimension \f$t\f$, it is possible to center
   * non-interlapping spheres of radius \f$ d_t \f$ where \f$ d_t \f$ is the
   * lenght of the shortest vector in the lattice. It turns out that the
   * proportion of the space covered by these spheres can be used as a figure of
   * merit for both the dual and the primal lattice. Suppose \f$ V \f$ contains
   * the basis of the lattice in its lines. Then the density of the lattice is
   * defined by \f$ \frac{1}{|\text{det}(V)|} \f$. It is the number of points
   * that the (not rescalled) lattice
   * will have in \f$[0,1)^t\f$. It is easy to see that the amount of space that
   * will be covered by the spheres is
   * \f[
   *    \text{Volume of an }n\text{-sphere of radius }d_n\times\text{Density of the lattice}}.
   * \f]
   * There are known upper bounds on the greatest proportion of the space that
   * can be covered in that way \cite mCON99a. If we divide the proportion of
   * the space covered in the current lattice by such an upper bound, the number
   * obtained is what we call **normalized**. This means that the number we will
   * get will be somewhere between 0 and 1 and that it can be used to compare the
   * distribution of the points of the lattice with the points of other lattices.
   * Having a value closer to 1 means a more evenly distributed lattice in some
   * way (see the section on the figures of merit to see which tests use this in
   * the intro). This class is intended as an interface to implement such
   * bounds. It is possible that subclasses of this one implement bounds for a
   * different interpretation of this problem, please look at their documentation
   * before using them. The bounds also sometimes use different norms.
   *
   * This base classe initializes the bounds at 1 and can be used if no
   * normalization can be done, or has to be done. This can be useful in a few
   * implementations if there is a switch at runtime to instanciate a
   * `Normalizer` subclass because there will be no need to duplicate the code
   * for the case with no normalization.
   *
   * To create a subclass of this one, it is important to implement the
   * getGamma(int) const, getBound(int) const and init() methods and to call
   * the init() method in the constructor to pre-compute the bounds this class
   * will use for normalization.
   * 
   * The constructors here do not compute any bounds, they basically just reserve 
   * the space (an array) for the bounds.
   *
   * To instanciate this class or its subclasses, the usage of the copy
   * constructor or of the assignment = is prohibited by the fact that these

 * and Lovasz (LLL) \cite mLEN82a&thinsp; as well as the method of Dieter
 * \cite rDIE75a&thinsp; to reduce a lattice basis.
 * The Minkowski, LLL and Branch-and-bound Reduction do not need the dual
 * lattice. Nonetheless, if a IntLatticeBasis object with a true with-dual
 * flag is given to a Reducer, the duality will be preserve during reduction.
 * Beside, the algorithm BKZ implemented in the NTL Library can be used
 * as a prereduction before the Branch-and-Bound.

   * merit so that a global figure of merit can be calculated as a weighted mean
   * of many figures of merit.
   *
   * This abstract class is the basis for different kinds of weights used to
   * accentuate the importance of some projections when computing
   * figures of merit for lattices or point sets. For more insight on what can
   * be done with weights, look what the subclasses implement. These classes are
   * not used directly by LatticeTester since LatticeTester does not implement
   * calculations of figure of merit for different projections of a point set.
   * For example usages, one should look at the LatNetBuilder and the LatMRG
   * software.
